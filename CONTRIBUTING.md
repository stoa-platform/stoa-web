# Contributing to STOA

First off, thank you for considering contributing to STOA! 🏛️

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to conduct@gostoa.dev.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** (config snippets, logs, etc.)
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include your environment** (OS, Docker version, K8s version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternatives you've considered**

### Creating Issues

We follow the **Marchemalo Standard** for issue quality. Every ticket should pass this test:

> *"Would an architect with 40 years of experience understand this issue in 30 seconds and know exactly what to deliver?"*

#### Required Elements

Each issue MUST include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎯 Objective** | One clear sentence stating what will be delivered |
| **💡 Why Now** | Context, urgency, and impact if not done |
| **📋 Deliverables** | Explicit list of what will be produced |
| **✅ Definition of Done** | Objective, verifiable criteria |
| **⏱️ Estimation** | Story points or time estimate |

#### Issue Template

```markdown
## 🎯 Objective
[One clear sentence]

## 💡 Why Now
[Context and urgency]

## 📋 Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Verifiable criterion 1
- [ ] Verifiable criterion 2
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

## ⏱️ Estimation
[X points] or [~Xh]

## 🔗 References
- Link 1
- Link 2
```

#### Anti-patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "Improve the site" | "Add 3 concrete use cases to /use-cases with diagrams" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Endpoint /v1/users returns 500 when email=null → return 400 with message" |
| "Documentation" | "Create ADR-005 for multi-tenant isolation decision" |
| No DoD | "Done when: tests pass + docs updated + review approved" |

#### Splitting Large Issues

If an issue is estimated at **> 5 story points**, it MUST be split into smaller issues.

#### Non-Conforming Issues

Issues that don't meet the Marchemalo Standard will be labeled `needs-triage` and require revision before being worked on.
